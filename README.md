# This project is my first independent project from bootdev

## This code aims to create a html file that print out the functions order of the application

### This project starts on Tuesday 30 July 2024 and ends on Saturday 3 August 2024. I've written comments for some of the code but too lazy to finish commenting.

Here are some limitations of this project:
- Only support non nested function, if multiple funciton is nested together, cannot detect it
- If the code file is too long, it won't work because the system stores all the code line in memory
- The code do poorly in recognizing functions within class

Special note: There are lot of print statement in the code, I decide to leave it there so the future person who working on this (probably me) is going to have a good time debugging
